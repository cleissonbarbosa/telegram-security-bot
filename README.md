## How to Create a Bot and Obtain a Token üõ†Ô∏è

To use this bot, you need to create your own bot on Telegram and obtain the access token. Follow the steps below:

1. **Access Telegram** and search for the bot called [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. **Start a conversation with BotFather** by sending `/start`.
3. **Create a new bot** by sending the command `/newbot` and follow the provided instructions. You will need to choose a name and a username for your bot.
4. After creating the bot, BotFather will provide an **API Token**. The token will look something like this: `123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmnOPqRsTuVWXyz`.

### How to Use the Token in the Code

Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in the code with the token you obtained from BotFather:

```python
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
```
